## Projects (Listing Representative Studies Only)

### Safety Plan of Drive-Thru in Seoul
- [Project Description]
  The policy research aimed at enhancing the safety of users of South Korea's first drive-thru (consisting of 49 locations) involved the assessment of traffic safety facilities and operational conditions at each store. It leveraged the findings of prior studies related to this topic. Based on these findings, strategies were proposed to improve user safety at the drive-thru locations.
  
- [Technologies Used]
  Field investigations were conducted.

### Development of Basic Plans and Manuals for Ensuring Traffic Safety in School Zones
- [Project Description]
 This project involves the analysis of traffic accident patterns within Seoul's extensive 1750 designated school zones. Through an in-depth examination of children's behavior characteristics, the study aims to propose various feasible measures (policies) to reduce traffic accidents in these school zones. Particularly, utilizing GIS, the study conducts an additional analysis of accident patterns based on road width, a factor that has not been previously explored

- [Technologies Used]
  The study involves the utilization of GIS and data collection using crawling techniques (Python).
  Plus, using R, characteristics extracted systematically from the analysis of traffic accidents.

### A Study on the Development of Road Safety Evaluation Method for National Highway
- [Project Description]
 To analyze the causes of traffic accidents on national highways, GIS-based data was collected. Using the collected data, various models were constructed, and the selected optimal model was used to perform an analysis of factors contributing to accidents.

- [Technologies Used]
  In this study, GIS was employed for systematic data collection, and accident prediction models were developed using machine learning-based accident prediction models and generalized regression models

### Consulting Service for Traffic Accident Prediction and Hazard Assessment of Jisan Interchange Exit
- [Project Description]
 This service evaluates the risk associated with the upcoming Jisan Interchange (IC) in Gwangju, South Korea. This interchange is designed with a left exit configuration, which is not commonly used in Korea. Due to the potential accident risks associated with this unique design, an analysis is conducted from both traffic flow and accident risk perspectives.

- [Technologies Used]
 From a traffic flow perspective, camera data and on-site surveys are used to create a driving environment, which is then incorporated into the micro-simulation tool VISSIM to determine congestion levels. Regarding accident risk("My part"), vehicle driving simulators are employed to analyze driver behavior based on GPS data, including attributes such as steering, acceleration, and speed. This analysis is conducted for both left and right exits, taking into account factors such as gender and age group, to predict potential hazards.

### Research on Longitudinal Slope Estimation Using Digital Elevation Model (co-Worker)
- [Summary] 
  This study proposes a method to derive road end slope using available data, by matching elevation information from the domestic digital elevation model with road link information. Based on the Seoul City standard link, elevation data at 4-meter intervals was generated, and individual slopes per unit distance were calculated. Utilizing this information, representative slopes were assigned to each road link. Subsequently, roads that are impassable for micro-mobility vehicles and roads with slippery surfaces due to heavy snowfall were identified. Additionally, the study discusses limitations and issues of utilizing the digital elevation model for road-based information, providing insights on precautions when implementing it
