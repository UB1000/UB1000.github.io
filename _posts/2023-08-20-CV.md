> > ### [Research on Longitudinal Slope Estimation Using Digital Elevation Model (co-Worker)]
> > > - [Summary] 
> > >   This study proposes a method to derive road end slope using available data, by matching elevation information from the domestic digital elevation model
> > >   with road link information. Based on the Seoul City standard link, elevation data at 4-meter intervals was generated, and individual slopes per unit
> > >   distance were calculated. Utilizing this information, representative slopes were assigned to each road link. Subsequently, roads that are impassable for
> > >   micro-mobility vehicles and roads with slippery surfaces due to heavy snowfall were identified. Additionally, the study discusses limitations and issues of

> > ## Conference

> > ### [The 2021 Korean Institute of ITS Spring Conference - A Study on Prioritization of IoT-Based Traffic Safety Facility Installation]
> > > - [Summary] 
> > >   This study presents a research on the prioritization method for installing IoT-based traffic safety facilities. The criteria for prioritization were 
> > >   categorized into: 1. Duplication of traffic safety facilities, 2. Necessity of information provision, and 3. Factors influencing traffic accident
> > >   occurrences. To confirm the duplication of traffic safety facilities, this study selected intersections as the analysis targets and identified the
> > >   duplication of traffic safety facilities conveying the same meaning for each analysis target. Next, considering the information exchange between autonomous
> > >   vehicles and IoT facilities, the study derived traffic safety facilities that need to provide information to autonomous vehicles using literature review and
> > >   expert consultation. Lastly, by utilizing the number of traffic accidents within the analysis targets, the study revealed factors significantly affecting
> > >   accident occurrences through the results obtained from the constructed model. Ultimately, based on these criteria, priorities for installing IoT-based
> > >   traffic safety facilities were determined.

> > ### [The 85th Academic Presentation Korean Society of Transportation - A Study of Eco-friendly Transportation Advanced Path Searching Using Gradient Analysis]
> > > - [Summary] 
> > >   The slope of bicycle paths was calculated using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data containing spatial information and Seoul city bicycle road data. Instead
> > >   of employing commonly used methods such as the "Slope-ArcGIS tool" or "Weighted Average Slope" to determine the slope, the roads were divided into points
> > >   at 3-meter intervals. The slope was then calculated using elevation differences and distances from adjacent points.
> > >
> > > - [Further Research] 
> > >   This approach was utilized for a Term
> > >   Project where Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was applied to predict bicycle speeds and travel based on actual bicycle riding data and road slopes. However,
> > >   due to limited samples, the project did not yield significant academic insights.

> >  ### [International Conference For Road Engineers - A Study on the Systematic Standard Model of School Zone Reflecting Various Road Factors in Seoul]
> > > - [Summary] 
> > >   This study aims to identify the factors influencing traffic accidents in 1,750 children protection zones within Seoul. Considering that approximately 50%
> > >   of accidents occurring in children protection zones over a 5-year period took place on roads with a width of 8 meters or less, the protection zones were
> > >   categorized based on the proportion of road width within their composition.
> > >   Subsequently, meaningful factors affecting accidents were derived for each categorized protection zone type using the XGBoost model. The results revealed
> > >   that in protection zones where a higher proportion of wider roads exist, the presence of speed bumps and protective fences contributes to accident
> > >   reduction. In contrast, for protection zones with a higher proportion of narrower roads, markings indicating the child protection zone and road reflectors
> > >   were found to have an accident-reducing effect.

> > ### I am currently undergoing review for more than two additional papers apart from this.
